# BARE

## Boilerplate Application Running Express

A learning project to construct a basic Express application, from scratch, without using the express application generator. The code is commented as I go.

The app sets up templating using Pug, routing, and static public files. Bare runs a local development server, and can be deployed as a heroku app. Not tested with other deployments.
